this is a ducky script which Exploits Windows $MFT Vulnerability. $MFT is used by NTFS systems to manage some metadata. Works on windows 7, 8 and vista, dont work on windows 10. 
I think work on Xp and earlier. The system crash lasts until the machine is switched off, or until the blue screen of death appears works on w7 - w8 - Vista (and i think xp and earlier too) it uses a high delay to support even older computers
